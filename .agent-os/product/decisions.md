## DEC-002: Flask vs FastAPI for Web Framework

**Date:** 2026-02-03  
**Status:** 🔍 Under Investigation  
**Deciders:** Technical Team

### Context

The current implementation uses Flask 3.0+ with Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket support. We need to evaluate whether Flask is the right choice for production or if FastAPI would be better.

### Options Considered

**Option A: Continue with Flask**
- ✅ Already implemented and working
- ✅ Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation
- ✅ Flask-SocketIO provides WebSocket support
- ✅ Jinja2 templating for server-side rendering

## DEC-003: aiortc vs Native WebRTC Implementation

**Date:** 2026-02-03  
**Status:** 🔍 Under Investigation  
**Deciders:** Technical Team

### Context

The current implementation uses aiortc (Python WebRTC library) for WebRTC peer connections. We need to evaluate whether this is the best approach for production.

### Options Considered

**Option A: Continue with aiortc**
- ✅ Pure Python implementation (no native dependencies)
- ✅ Already working with Unitree SDK
- ✅ Good integration with asyncio
- ✅ Active maintenance and community support
- ❌ Performance overhead compared to native WebRTC
- ❌ Limited codec support compared to native implementations

**Option B: Native WebRTC (libwebrtc bindings)**
- ✅ Better performance (native C++ implementation)
- ✅ Full codec support
- ✅ Industry-standard implementation
- ❌ Complex build process and dependencies
- ❌ Harder to debug and maintain
- ❌ May not integrate well with Unitree SDK

**Option C: Hybrid Approach (aiortc + native codecs)**
- ✅ Balance of Python convenience and native performance
- ✅ Use native codecs where performance critical
- ❌ Increased complexity
- ❌ More dependencies to manage

### Decision

**TO BE DECIDED** - Requires performance benchmarking

### Investigation Tasks

- [ ] Benchmark aiortc latency and throughput
- [ ] Test aiortc stability with 10+ concurrent connections
- [ ] Evaluate native WebRTC Python bindings (pywebrtc, etc.)
- [ ] Measure CPU/memory usage under load
- [ ] Assess Unitree SDK compatibility with alternatives

### Recommendation Criteria

- **Latency:** Must achieve <200ms video latency
- **Stability:** Must handle 24/7 operation without memory leaks
- **Scalability:** Must support 50+ concurrent connections per server
- **Maintainability:** Must be debuggable and maintainable by Python developers

## DEC-004: Server-Side PyAudio vs Browser Audio Capture

**Date:** 2025-12-XX (Implemented during audio feature development)  
**Status:** ✅ Accepted  
**Deciders:** Technical Team

### Context

For user-to-robot audio transmission (push-to-talk), we initially attempted browser-based audio capture with SocketIO transmission. This resulted in severe packet loss (browser sent 100+ packets, backend received only 5).

### Decision

Use **server-side PyAudio capture** instead of browser-based audio capture, bypassing SocketIO entirely for audio data transmission.

### Rationale

**Root Cause of Browser Approach Failure:**
- SocketIO with `async_mode='threading'` cannot handle high-frequency audio packets (48kHz sample rate)
- Browser MediaRecorder API generates many small packets
- Network latency and SocketIO overhead caused packet loss and audio degradation

**Server-Side Approach Benefits:**
- PyAudio captures PC microphone directly on server
- Audio data stays in Python process (no network transmission for capture)
- Custom `MicrophoneAudioTrack` class integrates with aiortc WebRTC
- Frames sent to robot via WebRTC data channel (reliable, low-latency)

### Implementation

```python
class MicrophoneAudioTrack(MediaStreamTrack):
    """Capture audio from PC microphone and transmit to robot via WebRTC"""
    
    async def recv(self):
        # Read from PyAudio stream using asyncio.to_thread()
        mic_data = await asyncio.to_thread(
            self.mic_stream.read,
            self.samples_per_frame,
            exception_on_overflow=False
        )
        # Convert to WebRTC audio frame and return
        ...
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Eliminated packet loss issue completely
- ✅ High-quality audio transmission (48kHz, 2 channels)
- ✅ Push-to-talk works reliably
- ✅ No browser compatibility issues

**Negative:**
- ❌ Requires PyAudio installation on server (platform-specific)
- ❌ Server must have microphone access (not suitable for headless cloud deployment)
- ❌ Cannot support multiple users transmitting audio simultaneously

### Future Considerations

For multi-user scenarios, may need to revisit browser-based audio with:
- WebRTC data channel instead of SocketIO
- Opus codec for efficient transmission
- Proper buffering and jitter handling

## DEC-005: Blocking I/O and Event Loop Management

**Date:** 2025-12-XX (Implemented during video degradation fix)
**Status:** ✅ Accepted
**Deciders:** Technical Team

### Context

When audio streaming was enabled, video quality degraded significantly with artifacts, high latency, and corrupted frames. Investigation revealed that PyAudio's blocking I/O operations were freezing the asyncio event loop.

### Decision

Use **`asyncio.to_thread()`** to offload all blocking PyAudio operations (`read()` and `write()`) to a thread pool, preventing them from blocking the event loop.

### Rationale

**Root Cause:**
- Video and audio callbacks run in the SAME asyncio event loop
- PyAudio's `stream.write()` and `stream.read()` are synchronous blocking operations
- When audio callback blocked on PyAudio I/O, video frames piled up in the queue
- Frame accumulation caused latency spikes and visual artifacts

**Solution:**
```python
async def recv_audio_stream(frame):
    """Receive audio from robot and play through speakers"""
    # Run blocking PyAudio write in separate thread
    await asyncio.to_thread(pyaudio_stream.write, audio_bytes)

async def recv(self):
    """Capture microphone audio for transmission"""
    # Run blocking PyAudio read in separate thread
    mic_data = await asyncio.to_thread(
        self.mic_stream.read,
        self.samples_per_frame,
        exception_on_overflow=False
    )
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Eliminated video degradation completely
- ✅ Smooth video quality even with audio enabled
- ✅ Established pattern for handling blocking I/O in async code
- ✅ Documented in best-practices.md for future development

**Negative:**
- ❌ Slight overhead from thread pool management
- ❌ Requires careful management of thread-safe operations

### Lessons Learned

**Critical Rule:** Never perform blocking I/O operations directly in asyncio event loop callbacks. Always use:
- `asyncio.to_thread()` for blocking operations
- `asyncio.create_task()` for async operations
- Thread pools for CPU-intensive work

This pattern is now documented in `.agent-os/standards/best-practices.md` and must be followed for all future async code.

## DEC-006: Flask-SocketIO Threading Mode

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Status:** 🔍 Under Investigation
**Deciders:** Technical Team

### Context

The current implementation uses Flask-SocketIO with `async_mode='threading'`. We need to evaluate whether this is optimal for production or if other modes (eventlet, gevent) would be better.

### Options Considered

**Option A: Continue with threading mode**
- ✅ Already implemented and working
- ✅ Compatible with standard Python threading
- ✅ No additional dependencies
- ❌ Limited scalability compared to eventlet/gevent
- ❌ Higher memory overhead per connection

**Option B: Switch to eventlet mode**
- ✅ Better scalability for many concurrent connections
- ✅ Lower memory overhead
- ✅ Recommended by Flask-SocketIO documentation
- ❌ Requires eventlet dependency
- ❌ May conflict with asyncio event loop
- ❌ Requires code changes for compatibility

**Option C: Switch to gevent mode**
- ✅ Similar benefits to eventlet
- ✅ Mature and stable
- ❌ Requires gevent dependency
- ❌ May conflict with asyncio event loop
- ❌ Requires code changes for compatibility

### Decision

**TO BE DECIDED** - Requires load testing and compatibility verification

### Investigation Tasks

- [ ] Load test threading mode with 50+ concurrent connections
- [ ] Test eventlet compatibility with aiortc and asyncio
- [ ] Test gevent compatibility with aiortc and asyncio
- [ ] Measure memory usage per connection for each mode
- [ ] Evaluate migration effort and risks

### Recommendation Criteria

- **Scalability:** Must support 50+ concurrent WebSocket connections
- **Compatibility:** Must work with aiortc and asyncio event loop
- **Stability:** Must handle 24/7 operation without issues
- **Migration Risk:** Must not break existing functionality

## DEC-007: TDD Testing Philosophy

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Status:** ✅ Accepted
**Deciders:** Product Owner, Technical Team

### Context

The project currently has minimal testing (test files cleared, only 1 line each). We need to establish a testing philosophy for production development.

### Decision

Adopt **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach for all new features and refactoring work.

### Rationale

**Why TDD:**
- **Enterprise Quality:** Commercial fleet management requires high reliability
- **Refactoring Safety:** Comprehensive tests ensure refactoring doesn't break functionality
- **Documentation:** Tests serve as executable documentation of expected behavior
- **Regression Prevention:** Automated tests catch regressions early
- **Design Improvement:** Writing tests first leads to better API design

**TDD Workflow:**
1. Write failing test for new feature
2. Implement minimum code to make test pass
3. Refactor code while keeping tests green
4. Repeat for next feature

### Implementation

**Testing Stack:**
- **Framework:** pytest 7.4+
- **Async Testing:** pytest-asyncio
- **Mocking:** pytest-mock, unittest.mock
